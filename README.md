We build this website using AngularJS, NodeJS and css.

London is waiting for you!
Our website is about the tourist city London, which reveal for you various options and things to do in the form of points of interests(POIs).

In the "home" or "login" option in the navigation bar (NB) you have to login if you are a registered user. 
If not, there is the option to sign up ("Join the fun" option in "Home" or "Register" in NB).

As a logged in user the toolbar options are (NB):

Home: This is the home page and you can watch the POIs recommended for you and the last POIs you liked.

About: Displays general details about the site.

Points Of Interests: you can watch all the proposed POIs and view them by category.

Anywhere on site, with a click on the POI, a new page will be opende and display the desired location with more details.

In that page of POI, you can add to favorites (click on the heart icon),view the last two reviews recorded for this POI, adding a comment or update if you have previously added ("Rate it" button).(optional only for registered users)
In addition, you can see the location of the POI on the London map.

My favorites: centralize all the POIs you liked (clicked on their heart icon). There you can save your favorite path (then all the POIs of the path will have a london flag beside them). (optional only for registered user).

At any given time logout can be done by clicking on it in the navigation bar (optional only for registered user).


Wishing great pleasure from the website,
and hoping it will help you plan your perfect trip to London.
